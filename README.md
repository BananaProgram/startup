## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
I read through the Markdown page linked in the instructions and now I should know enough to keep my files organized.
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
I wrote the elevator pitch below as a very quick description of what I hope my webapp will be able to do.
- [x] Description of key features
I described the key things that my webapp should be able to do by the end of the semester, although I may have been slightly ambitious.
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
I categorized all the functions of the webapp into what technology they will need to use.
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.
I used NinjaMock to create a rough sketch of what the main page of the webapp should look like after the user is logged in.

### Elevator pitch

It is a sad truth that it is currently quite impossible to obtain a pet dinosaur. Don't fret! Introducing: Dino Pals, a way to befriend and take care of your very own ancient reptiles. Whether you want to raise your favorite dinosaur all on your own or show off your adorably terrifying collection to your friends, Dino Pals is the webapp for you. Come hatch your first egg today!

### Design

### Key features

- A shop which will include dinosaur eggs, food, and various aesthetic options; the currency will be dinosaur scales
- Eggs will develop more cracks over time before hatching, then the baby dinos will go through a few stages of growth before reaching adulthood
- Adult dinos will regularly shed scales if they are kept happy and healthy
- Users can take care of their dinos by feeding them and playing with them
- Users can connect with friends and view their friends' dinosaurs (maybe they can feed and play with their friends' dinosaurs too)

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - 3 HTML pages: login, dino enclosure, and shop. Hyperlinks to view friends' enclosures.
- **CSS** - Webapp should be designed to look good on screen sizes ranging from a smartphone to a desktop computer. Color palette should be designed so that all available colors in the shop will look good together.
- **React** - Used for login, displaying dinosaurs and options in the shop, provides interactivity such as feeding dinosaurs and making purchases.
- **Service** - Retrieving what dinos the user has purchased and their info including age, happiness, and hunger, submitting new purchases of dinosaurs, food, and aesthetic options, and retrieving friends list and hyperlinks to view their enclosures. Access Colormind API for help with color palette generation.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, purchases, currency balance, and friends list. Login should be secure and you should not be able to use the webapp without logging in.
- **WebSocket** - Send invitations to friends and accept invitations from others. View friends' enclosures.
